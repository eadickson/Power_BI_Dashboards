# My Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

In this repository I share some of my Power BI Dashboards. These visualizations represent the most relevant insights extracted from data, for the goal of each project. The steps involve from foundational to advanced concepts, all combined for a concise, meaningful result.

# Featured Dashboards

Each dashboard below has its own README file, where you can find more information about the creation process.
