## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **Job Seekers** in general. Data about job market generally appear dispersed; the project from which this dashboard was created addresses the issue. The project groups a huge amount of data from a *real world dataset of 2024 data science job postings* (including titles, salaries, and locations, all kindly provided by Luke Barousse, data analysis expert and extraordinary educator). This dashboard is a single, easy-to-use interface that allows to explore job market trends and compensation. 

## Skills Showcased

- **Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like 'Median Yearly Salary' and 'Job Count'.
- **Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
- **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
- **Interactive Reporting:**
    - **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    - **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamleass navigation experience.
    - **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
